## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed `NullPointerException` at runtime when invoking connector functions with enum-typed parameters. `ParamHandler` now handles the `ENUM` type case by converting the string value to a `BString`. ([#4829](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4829))
- Fixed `ClassCastException` when passing `map` or `record` typed parameters from Synapse templates that wrap JSON values in single quotes. `cleanupJsonString` now strips surrounding single quotes before parsing. ([#4830](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4830))
- Fixed enum parameter default values being generated as the Ballerina identifier name (e.g. `DEFAULT`) instead of the actual constant value (e.g. `0`) in the UI schema. `BalConnectorAnalyzer` now resolves enum constant identifiers to their runtime values via the semantic model. ([#4831](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4831))
- Fixed `InherentTypeViolation` runtime errors by ensuring generic maps and arrays are explicitly converted to their expected inherent types before Ballerina function invocation. This includes strict matching for Union member selection and recursive unwrapping of Intersection and Type Reference types. ([#4828](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4828))
- Fixed union map parameter pointer mismatch in `XmlPropertyWriter` where the generated `init.xml` property used `config_map` (underscore) while the `<parameter>` declaration and uischema field both used `configMap` (camelCase). This caused `lookupTemplateParameter` to return null for `map<string>` union members, propagating as a null argument to `createObjectValue` and triggering a `NullPointerException` in the Ballerina connector's `init` method. ([#4811](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4811))
- Fixed `typedesc`-backed union parameters generating spurious `<parameter>` declarations and union pointer properties in functions XML. Member parameters and pointer properties are now suppressed via `{{#unless typeDescriptor}}` guards; only the discriminator `DataType` property is emitted, matching the runtime's `typedesc` resolution path. ([#4812](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4812))
- Fixed attribute group `enableCondition` not being propagated when all child fields of a grouped union member share the same condition. The condition is now promoted to the enclosing `attributeGroup` (merged with any parent condition), so MI Studio correctly hides or shows the group when its union branch is deselected. ([#4813](https://github.com/wso2/product-integrator-mi/issues/4813))

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Fixed resource function invocations hanging on the second request due to Strand lifecycle not being properly managed. The `BalExecutor` now calls `strand.done()` in a `finally` block and uses `CompletableFuture.get()` instead of polling, ensuring HTTP connections are released back to the pool.
- Fixed JVM method name generation for resource functions with special characters in path segments (e.g., Slack's `auth.test`). Dots, slashes, and other JVM-reserved characters are now encoded using Ballerina's `&XXXX` format (e.g., `.` → `&0046`), with proper unescaping of Ballerina identifier escape sequences before encoding.
- Fixed invalid XML parameter names caused by forward slashes and backslashes in Ballerina record field names (e.g., `prefs\/externalMembersDisabled`). `sanitizeParamName` now replaces `\/`, `/`, and `\` with underscores.
- Fixed dots appearing in generated Synapse operation/template names for connectors with dot-separated path segments (e.g., Slack). `toPascalCase`, `toPascalCaseSegment`, and `sanitizeXmlName` now treat dots as word separators, producing names like `getAdminAppsApprovedList` instead of `getAdmin_.apps_.approved_.list`.
- Fixed `NumberFormatException` when optional parameters are missing from request JSON. `json-eval()` returns empty string `""` for missing fields; `ParamHandler` and `DataTransformer.setNestedField` now convert empty strings to null/skip for non-string types, allowing Ballerina to receive `()` (nil) for optional parameters.
- Fixed Ballerina execution errors not being propagated properly from the `BalExecutor`. `InterruptedException` and `ExecutionException` from `CompletableFuture.get()` are now handled explicitly with proper interrupt flag restoration and `BError` unwrapping.
- Fixed union parameter handling for connector init configurations. Union member pointers, record fields, and discriminator properties are now correctly emitted in `init.xml`, and record-typed union members are properly reconstructed from flattened context fields.
- Fixed connection-type prefix not being propagated in `ParamHandler.getUnionParameter`, which caused runtime errors when resolving union parameters in connectors with prefixed property keys (e.g., SAP JCo).
- Fixed an infinite recursion bug in `XmlPropertyWriter` caused by cyclic nested `UnionFunctionParam` types (e.g., `ClientCredentialsGrantConfig`). The generator now tracks visited types and stops recursive property unrolling cleanly.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-05
